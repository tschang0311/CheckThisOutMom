            <div class="description description-text">In 2022, Quizlet transitioned its popular "Learn" mode, along with other key features like "Test" mode, to a premium offering, restricting free access to these tools. This shift frustrated many long-time users who had relied on these features for years. Among them was CToM, a dedicated Quizlet user who was particularly dismayed by this change. In response, CToM created Kwizletâ€”a free, lightweight, and engaging flashcard application designed to bring back the accessibility and fun that users loved. Kwizlet was born out of a desire to offer an alternative that stays true to the original spirit of free and open learning.</div>
