            <div class="description">An Audio Based Video Game.</div>
            <div class="description description-text">This project, developed in 2024 by four University of Chicago students, focuses on creating an inclusive video game that is engaging for both visually impaired and sighted players, aiming to bridge the social gap in gaming. The game, "Marshini Mansion," uses a keyboard as a physical representation of the game space, where players receive auditory feedback and navigate through a haunted mansion. The design emphasizes dynamic pacing, risk-taking, and immersive audio cues to create an adrenaline-inducing experience. While user feedback highlighted the need for an improved tutorial and additional features, such as a help key and better monster detection, to enhance gameplay and accessibility, the game has been positively received as fun and challenging.</div>
