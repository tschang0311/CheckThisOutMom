            <div class="description description-text">AMO, developed in 2024 by three University of Chicago students, is an innovative system designed to assist plant owners in monitoring and maintaining the health of their houseplants. Recognizing the challenges that new plant owners often face, such as identifying plant species, diagnosing diseases, and understanding the specific care needs of different plants, AMO offers an automated solution. The system uses a Raspberry Pi equipped with a high-quality camera to capture images of plant leaves and gather soil temperature and moisture data. Leveraging a ResNet-9 model, AMO identifies the plant species and any potential diseases from the leaf images, and then dynamically adjusts care recommendations based on the plant's needs. The system displays real-time health status, temperature, and moisture levels on a user-friendly terminal interface, utilizing color-coded messages to guide users in caring for their plants. Despite hardware and design limitations, AMO has shown promising results in accurately identifying plant species and their health conditions, providing a valuable tool for both novice and experienced plant owners.</div>
